This is my first experience of analysing huge data using Machine Learning.

Data are taken from the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss.org/) (SDSS), in three categories: Star, Galaxy, Quasar. And the model is built on top of [Keras library](https://keras.io/).

**[UPDATE]** Enhanced result (*2085 wrong predicted among 317520 test data*):
